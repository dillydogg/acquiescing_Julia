# DataFrames.jl

Welcome to DataFrames.jl with Bogumił Kamiński

The material is organized in six notebooks that are recommended to be studied in
the specified sequence. In order to make sure that the notebooks work correctly
please download the whole repository and start Jupyter Notebook in the
directory where the downloaded files are located.

This tutorial is intended to be an introduction to the DataFrames.jl package and
the related ecosystem. It is task-oriented, so it aims to show how available
functionality can be used to solve typical data wrangling problems.

If you are interested in in-depth coverage of all functions and their options
that are provided in the DataFrames.jl package please consult
[the documentation](https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/) or a more
advanced tutorial that is available
[here](https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial).

This version of the manual was tested with:
* Julia 1.5.3, 1.6.1, and 1.7.0;
* DataFrames.jl 0.22.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0.

The current version of the manual uses the new Manifest.toml format that
was introduced in Julia 1.7.0. If you are on an older version of Julia
consider working with
[1.2.0 release](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/DataFrames/releases/tag/1.2.0)
of this tutorial.
